# alt-text [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/double-great/alt-text.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/double-great/alt-text)

Alt text describes an image. This description provides context for people with low or no vision. The text is a fallback for users with images turned off or when an image fails to load.

The usefulness of alt text can be subjective. Context, detail, length, and relevance contribute to the quality of the description. Determining alt text quality is a manual effort, but there are patterns to avoid.

`altText` checks for common issues found in alt text and suggests improvements.

Are you writing in markdown? We recommend using [remark-lint-alt-text](https://github.com/double-great/remark-lint-alt-text).

## Install

```
npm install @double-great/alt-text
```

## Usage

If `altText` detects an issue, it will return a warning to help you fix it. If `altText` doesn't detect any issues it will return `undefined`.

```js
const altText = require("@double-great/alt-text");

console.log(altText("A child holding a photograph."));
// undefined

console.log(altText("A screenshot of a dog"));
// Alt text should not contain "screenshot of". Alt text should end in a period.
```

## Warnings

<!-- this section is generated on commit !-->

### Empty alt text

Warning: `Alt text should not be a single space`

If you use a null (empty) text alternative (`alt=""`) to hide decorative images, make sure that there is no space character in between the quotes. **If a space character is present, the image may not be effectively hidden from assistive technologies.** For instance, some screen readers will still announce the presence of an image if a space character is put between the quotes.

### Character length

Warning: `Alt text length should be less than 125 characters`

Alt text should be less than 125 characters in length. The JAWS screen reader reads alt text in 125 character chunks.

### End in a period
